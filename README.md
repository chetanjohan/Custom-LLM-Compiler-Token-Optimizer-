# LLM Token Compiler Optimizer

This project is aimed at optimizing token sequences generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve performance, reduce token cost, or enhance efficiency.

## Goals
- Optimize token streams
- Reduce token usage cost for models like OpenAI's GPT
- Possibly implement compression or reordering algorithms

## Structure (planned)
- /src : Core logic
- /data : Sample token inputs
- /tests : Unit tests for optimizer

## How to use
To be updated...
